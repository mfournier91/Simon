## Project Workflow
Excelling - Great planning. Seems like you hit your wireframe pretty accurately. Also you acheived some of your gold user stories.

## Technical Requirements
Excelling - Great work getting simon running. Also you've used local storage and an animation library. Very cool!

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is pretty well maintained and encapsulated. I love that you've commented your code for parts that are a bit complicated. However, there are definitely some refactoring opportunities here(read comments in `script.js`). There's also a bit of commented out code that you should take out for production.

## Creativity Interface
Performing - You're simon app was super cool! Really love the animations. I would love to see you tackle some more of your gold user stories like the button pressing and such.

## Overall
Really great work Marc! Looking forward to future projects!
