This Simon game is made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, including Jquery and a library called greensock which is for animations. My approach in making this game was to follow my pseudo code. However I soon realized that wrapping the whole game in a for loop is not an effective way to control the flow, instead I used function calls to control the flow.
  To install: you should click the clone button, copy the clone link, launch a terminal window change to a directory you want the repo to be in, type ```git clone URL```, subbing the url that you copied. Change into the directory that was just added. Enter ```open index.html```.
